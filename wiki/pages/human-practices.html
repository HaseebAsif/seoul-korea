    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>When browsing through photos of oil-covered beaches, birds, and other marine wildlife, it is evident that oil-spills are environmental disasters. What is not reflected in those photos, however, is the extensive and wide-spread effect an incident can have on human life. Because both the cause and result of oil-spills involve humans, actively reflecting on how our eco-friendly oil sorbent interacts with the world is an integral part of our project.</p>
    <p>Though we were aware of the importance of human practices, we had no idea of the ways and depth that these activities had on the direction and execution of our project. As can be seen below in a loose summary of our human practice initiatives, our activities have led to both expected and unexpected consequences for our project, all of which have </p>
    <h4>Taean Oil Spill Memorial</h4>
    <p>In order to appreciate the human cause and pain of oil spills, we started our human practice activities with a visit to the Taean District oil spill memorial. The 2007 oil spill remains the largest oil spill in Korean history, with an estimated 10,500 tons of crude oil spilled into the waters surrounding Mallipo beach.</p>
    <p>What was immediately noticeable from our visit was both the scale and wide spectrum of damage inflicted on communities surrounding the area. Apart from the obvious damage on the local economy and environment, we could appreciate the plethora of psychological and medical problems that local communities suffered from. Given the lack of proper personal protective equipment (PPE) and emergency supplies of oil sorbents, local fishermen, volunteers, and the mobilized Korean army had to resort to labor intensive clean-up methods and reusing unwashed PPE.</p>

    <p>On this page, your team should document all of your Human Practices work and activities. You should write about the Human Practices topics you considered in your project, document any activities you conducted to explore these topics (such as engaging with experts and stakeholders), describe why you took a particular approach (including referencing any work you built upon), and explain if and how you integrated takeaways from your Human Practices work back into your project purpose, design and/or execution.</p>
